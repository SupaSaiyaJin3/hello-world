Just Another Repository 
I want to learn Python, Java, C++ and many more things about coding and programming in general. 
I really hope that learning code will change my life and bring me better career opportunities. 
I want to continue on in my life with the satisfaction that I accomplished something worthwhile and that it will bring me great fortune and success.
